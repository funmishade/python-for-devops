python is a dynamic typed language because you dont declare explicitly

always ask if there ar einbuilt functions to support your task
learn the inbuilt functions of thedifferent data types

If you use a windows machine (I use a Windows 10) do the following to activate a virtual environment

D:\workspace> python -m venv project-one

D:\workspace> cd project-one

D:\workspace\project-one> Scripts\activate

(project-one) D:\workspace\project-one> # you should see your virtual environment folder name in brackets at the start of every line in the command prompt. This indicates that your virtual environment is now active

To deactivate

(project-one) D:\workspace\project-one> deactivate
